A queue is a linear data structure that contains elements in an ordered sequence.
It is an abstract data type, pretty similar to a stack data structure and also different fundamentally.
We insert data at one end of the queue and remove data from the other end.

Here are a few more real-life applications of queues:

>Luggage checking machine
>Vehicles on toll tax bridge
>One way exits
>Patients waiting outside the doctorâ€™s clinic
>Phone answering systems
>Cashier line in a store

*** Types of Queue ***

There are four different types of queue that are listed as follows -

>Simple Queue or Linear Queue
>Circular Queue
>Priority Queue
>Double Ended Queue (or Deque)

Simple Queue or Linear Queue

In Linear Queue, an insertion takes place from one end while the deletion occurs from another end.
The end at which the insertion takes place is known as the rear end, and the end at which the deletion
takes place is known as front end. It strictly follows the FIFO rule.

The major drawback of using a linear Queue is that insertion is done only from the rear end.
If the first three elements are deleted from the Queue, we cannot insert more elements even 
though the space is available in a Linear Queue. In this case, the linear Queue shows the overflow
condition as the rear is pointing to the last element of the Queue.
